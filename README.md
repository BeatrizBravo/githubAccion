# GithubAccion

#### My definition
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows us to automate our:
- build, 
- test, and 
- deployment pipeline or process.

We can create workflows that build and test every pull request to our repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production. 


You can learn more about GitHub Actions by visiting their documentation page.
